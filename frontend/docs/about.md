## Hi, I'm Steve 👋

I'm a **product manager**, **frontend developer**, **avid cyclist**, and **casual pianist**.

I'm currently a **Senior Product Manager** at [Workato](https://www.workato.com), where I manage a suite of platform connectors and stateful data storage solutions, modernizing legacy systems and guiding cross-functional teams from vision to execution.

Previously, I was a **Product Manager** at [Shopee](https://shopee.sg), improving the buyer-seller chat experience across mobile and web platforms. Before moving into product management, I spent three years as a **Software Engineer** at [Amadeus](https://www.amadeus.com), where I modernized the Airport Management System’s dashboard and reporting module, improved the stability of its messaging system, and built productivity tools including [Figma Plugins](https://www.figma.com/@stevahnes) that reached more than 37,000 users and 240 likes.

My journey into software began at [Works Applications](https://www.worksap.sg/), where I started as a **Graduate Software Engineer**. Before that, I spent a year as a **Research Officer** after earning my Bachelor of Engineering (Product Development) from [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). My research on impulse shaping to suppress oscillations in spherical rolling robots was [published](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8014259) at the IEEE Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM) Conference in 2017.

Outside of work, I enjoy **cycling**, **practicing yoga**, and **going to the gym**. The [longest ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/11811566357) I've completed was a 120km loop around Singapore. My most challenging ride to date was a triple climb of [Page Mill Rd, Pescadero, and Tunitas Creek](https://www.strava.com/activities/12183241879) in the Bay Area. I also enjoy playing the **piano** casually. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, I challenged myself to record **30 covers in 30 days**, which I compiled into a [playlist on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/stevanus-satria/sets/piano-covers).

Whether I’m cycling, playing piano, or building software, I love tackling challenges, learning new things, and creating experiences that matter. Want to learn more or have a conversation about products, tech, or hobbies? Get [Advocado](/) to help you drop me a note!
