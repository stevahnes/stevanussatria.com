## 💬 Welcome to My AMA!

This is a space where you can literally ask me anything. Curious about my work, hobbies, projects, or just random stuff? Go for it.

Here’s how it works:

- Drop your questions in the thread below.
- I’ll reply as best (and as honestly!) as I can.
- Feel free to chime in on other people’s questions too.
- Keep it respectful and fun!

So… what’s on your mind?

<script setup lang="ts">
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'
const Giscus = defineAsyncComponent(() => 
  import('./components/Giscus.vue')
)
</script>

<Giscus />
